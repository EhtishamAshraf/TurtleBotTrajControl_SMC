# 8-shape Trajectory Following
The trajectory is mathematically defined using parametric equations to create a smooth figure-eight path. Two controllers are used for this purpose: 
1.  Flatness-Based Trajectory Controller (FBTC)
2.  Flatness-Based Sliding Mode Controller (FBSMC)
   
The robot starts at a predefined position (X = 0, Y = 0, heading angle = ) and follows the trajectory using real-time velocity commands generated by the controllers. Both methods are compared in terms of tracking accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Data collected during the execution, including actual poses and errors, are logged in an Excel file for analysis. 
Results are visualized as plots, showing the reference trajectory, the robot's actual path with both controllers. The project demonstrates effective trajectory tracking, with comparisons highlighting the strengths of each control method for handling nonlinear dynamics.

### Mathematical Formulation of the Desired Trajectory
The 8-shaped trajectory is generated using parametric equations, defining the desired position, velocity, and acceleration at any given time \( t \). These values are used for accurate trajectory tracking by the controllers.

#### Target Trajectory
The desired position of the robot along the $x$- and $y$-axes is defined as:
- $x_{\text{target}} = A \cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t)$
- $y_{\text{target}} = B \cdot \sin(2 \cdot \omega \cdot t)$

**Variables:**
- $A$: Amplitude constant that defines the size of the trajectory along the $x$-axis.
- $B$: Amplitude constant that defines the size of the trajectory along the $y$-axis.
- $\omega$: Angular velocity that controls the speed of traversal.
- $t$: Time variable.

#### First Derivative (Velocity)
The velocity components along the $x$- and $y$-axes are given by:
- $\dot{x}_{\text{target}} = A \cdot \omega \cdot \cos(\omega \cdot t)$
- $\dot{y}_{\text{target}} = 2 \cdot B \cdot \omega \cdot \cos(2 \cdot \omega \cdot t)$

These represent the desired linear velocities of the robot.

#### Second Derivative (Acceleration)
The acceleration components for the trajectory are derived as:
- $\ddot{x}_{\text{target}} = -A \cdot \omega^2 \cdot \sin(\omega \cdot t)$
- $\ddot{y}_{\text{target}} = -4 \cdot B \cdot \omega^2 \cdot \sin(2 \cdot \omega \cdot t)$

These values are used to refine control inputs and ensure smooth motion tracking.

##### Purpose
These equations are implemented in the trajectory tracking code, allowing the controllers (e.g., FBTC and FBSMC) to calculate the necessary control inputs for precise 8-shaped trajectory following by the TurtleBot. The dynamic computation of motion parameters ensures accuracy and robustness during real-time execution.

## Flatness-Based Trajectory Controller (FBTC)
FBTC is a control approach that leverages the differential flatness property of dynamic systems. In FBTC, the systemâ€™s states and inputs are expressed in terms of flat outputs and their derivatives. This method allows for the generation of feasible trajectories and simplifies the design of control laws, as trajectory planning and tracking can be decoupled. FBTC is particularly effective for systems like mobile robots, where precise trajectory tracking, such as following an 8-shaped path, is required.

## Flatness-Based Sliding Mode Controller (FBSMC)
FBSMC combines the principles of flatness-based control with sliding mode control (SMC) to achieve robust trajectory tracking. While flatness-based control simplifies trajectory planning, sliding mode control enhances robustness by handling uncertainties and disturbances. In FBSMC, a sliding surface is defined based on the flat outputs, ensuring that the system states converge to the desired trajectory even in the presence of external disturbances or model uncertainties. This approach is well-suited for applications requiring both precision and robustness, such as mobile robots navigating complex paths.

# Robot's Pose data
While the robot is following the 8 shape trajectory, its position and orientation data are continuously recorded in a .csv file. This stored data is later utilized to do the comparison of FBTC and FBSMC.
The table below displays some of the logged data obtained from the real Turtlebot3 while the FBSMC controller was in operation. This data includes various parameters such as time, position, orientation, velocity, and angular velocity, which are essential for analyzing the performance of the trajectory-following task.

# MATLAB-Based Comparison of Controllers

As part of this project, a detailed performance comparison was conducted between the two implemented controllers: **FBTC (Flatness-Based Trajectory Control)** and **FBSMC (Flatness-Based Sliding Mode Control)**. The analysis was carried out using MATLAB to evaluate key performance metrics based on trajectory tracking accuracy, robustness, and response to disturbances.

### Performance Metrics Evaluated
1. Tracking Accuracy:
   - The deviation of the actual robot trajectory from the reference 8-shaped trajectory was computed for both controllers.
   - The plots in MATLAB are created using the logged data from hardware.

2. Robustness to Disturbances:
   - The controllers were tested under external disturbances.
   - FBSMC showed better disturbance rejection due to its inherent robustness from sliding mode control.


### Key Observations
- **FBTC**:
  - Provided smooth and precise tracking under nominal conditions.
  - Less effective in the presence of external disturbances.

- **FBSMC**:
  - Demonstrated strong robustness to disturbances, maintaining trajectory tracking even under adverse conditions.
  - Introduced chattering due to sliding mode behavior.

### MATLAB Visualization
The following plots were generated using MATLAB for both controllers:
1. Trajectory Tracking:
   - Overlay of the reference trajectory and the actual trajectory for FBTC and FBSMC.
2. Control Inputs:
   - Visualization of linear and angular velocities applied by the controllers.
3. Comparison of $\theta$ (Heading Angle):
   - Comparison of the robot's heading angle ($\theta$) over time using both controllers

#### Quantitative Comparison between FBTC and FBSMC

| **Metric**                   | **FBTC** | **FBSMC** |
|------------------------------|----------|-----------|
| **IAE**                      | 8.2070   | 6.0114    |
| **RMSE**                     | 0.2855   | 0.2228    |
| **Average Error (avgp)**     | 0.0118   | 0.0144    |


These results showcase the trade-offs between the two controllers and provide insights into selecting the appropriate control method based on application requirements.

#### Checking TurtleBot Movement

Once the above steps are completed, you can test your TurtleBot's hardware functionality:

   - On your laptop, run the teleoperation node to control the TurtleBot manually:
     ```bash
     rosrun turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
     ```

2. Hardware Testing:
   - Run your trajectory nodes or the test scripts provided in the repository for straight-line or circular movement to ensure proper functioning of the TurtleBot.

After following these steps, the TurtleBot should be fully configured and operational in the real-world environment!

# Running the Hardware
After following the steps 1 - 3 of the section *Running ROS on TurtleBot3 and Laptop*, run the following command (on a new terminal) to run FBTC and FBSMC respectively.
  ```bash
  rosrun trajectory_control_pkg FBTC_8_shape.py
  ```
  ```bash
  rosrun trajectory_control_pkg FBSMC_8_shape.py
  ```

# Check Robot Movement
The `trajectory_control_pkg` also includes three essential nodes to verify the robot's proper connection and functionality. These nodes allow you to test straight-line movement, circular movement, and adjust the robot's heading angle. These features help ensure the robot is correctly connected and responding as expected before running more complex control algorithms.

The figure below illustrates the circular trajectory followed by the robot during its movement:

#### Parametric Equations for Circular Trajectory
For the robot to follow a circular trajectory, the desired position along the $x$- and $y$-axes is given by the following parametric equations:

- ${\text{XdesPos}} = \text{radius} \cdot \cos(\text{omega} \cdot t)$  
- ${\text{YdesPos}} = \text{radius} \cdot \sin(\text{omega} \cdot t)$  

The velocity components along the $x$- and $y$-axes are calculated as:

- $Vx = -\text{radius} \cdot \text{omega} \cdot \sin(\text{omega} \cdot t)$  
- $Vy = \text{radius} \cdot \text{omega} \cdot \cos(\text{omega} \cdot t)$  

##### Explanation:
- Radius: Determines the size of the circular path.
- Angular Velocity: Controls how quickly the robot moves along the circular trajectory.
- $time (t)$: Represents the time variable.
